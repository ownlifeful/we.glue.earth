# we.glue.earth Open Source Software Cooperative

## Vision

Our mission is to empower people through collective action and technology. We strive to create an environment where individuals can fully unleash their talents and potential, breaking free from the limitations of traditional work roles. Starting with the **Alexandria3000** app, we are building a foundation for a democratized and decluttered collection of all human knowledge.

## Empowerment, Freedom, and Inclusivity

- **Work from Anywhere:** Geography is no limit. You have the freedom to contribute from wherever you are in the world.
- **Flexible Participation:** Full-time or part-time, morning bird or night owl, your work schedule is in your hands.
- **Equal Opportunity for All:** We cultivate a welcoming and diverse environment, without discrimination.
- **More Than Just a Role:** We recognize and celebrate the multi-faceted talents of our members. You are not just a job title here; you are a whole individual.

  - *Example:* Hired for business development but passionate about music? We are excited to explore how your musical talents can enrich our community and our projects.
 
  
- **Democratic Voice:** In our cooperative, each member has a voice. You can propose new projects, adjustments to workflows, or ideas to enhance our working environment through our decision-making system. Your voice matters.

  - *Example:* Feel we could enhance our software with a new feature? Draft a proposal, share your ideas, and let the entire cooperative decide collaboratively.

## Cooperative Policies

### Equal Ownership

Every worker owns an equal share in the cooperative, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to our collective mission and values.

### Hiring Process

- **Contract-to-Hire:** New recruits start as contract-to-hire workers for a 3-month period.
- **Peer Approval:** After 3 months, all employees vote on whether the new recruit will be hired as a permanent member.

### Reward System

- **Peer Review:** Employees are peer-reviewed regularly.
- **Performance Bonuses:** Employees collectively decide on awarding bonuses from the cooperative‚Äôs collective funds based on exceptional performance.

### Policy on Leaving the Cooperative

- If a worker decides to leave, their share will be bought out, and they will be compensated, ensuring the ownership remains with the current workers.

## Democratic Operation

Our cooperative functions as a democracy. We elect officers, maintain a charter and bylaws, hold regular meetings, and keep minutes.

### Collective Decision Making

We use a points-based system for collective decision-making, where each employee is granted 1000 points. Proposals are made by members and voted upon using these points.

## Shared Success and Fair Incentives

- **Autonomy and Trust:** We trust you to communicate effectively, attend scheduled meetings (online or offline), and meet shared goals with autonomy.
- **Shared Prosperity:** When the cooperative succeeds, we all benefit financially and professionally. We all share the same goals and incentives.
