# Open Source Software Cooperative

## Vision

Our mission is to build a de-commercialized, democratized, and decluttered collection of all human knowledge. We aim to create a foundation for future innovators to build upon, starting with the **Alexandria3000** app. We unite skilled individuals from various backgrounds, including programmers, designers, artists, writers, and more, to work collaboratively on meaningful, cutting-edge open-source projects.

## The Alexandria3000 App

**Alexandria3000** is designed as an AI-powered app aiming to revolutionize the way we learn and master Computer Science. It dynamically adjusts to an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency and accelerates the learning process. For more about the app, visit [Alexandria3000.org](http://alexandria3000.org).

## Cooperative Policies

### Equal Ownership

Every worker owns an equal share in the cooperative, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to our mission and values.

### Hiring Process

- **Contract-to-Hire:** New recruits start as contract-to-hire workers for a 3-month period.
- **Peer Approval:** After 3 months, all employees vote on whether the new recruit will be hired as a permanent member.

### Reward System

- **Peer Review:** Employees are peer-reviewed regularly.
- **Performance Bonuses:** Employees collectively decide on awarding bonuses from the cooperative‚Äôs collective funds based on exceptional performance.

### Policy on Leaving the Cooperative

- If a worker decides to leave, their share will be bought out, and they will be compensated, ensuring the ownership remains with the current workers.

## Democratic Operation

Our cooperative is committed to functioning as a democracy. We elect officers, maintain a charter and bylaws, hold regular meetings, and keep minutes.

### Collective Decision Making

We use a points-based system for collective decision-making, where each employee is granted 1000 points. Proposals are made by members and voted upon using these points. 

**How It Works:**
1. Each employee can create proposals, which outline a specific course of action for the cooperative.
2. Employees vote for or against proposals by allocating their points accordingly.
3. The system totals the for/against allocations for each proposal to determine whether it will be implemented.
4. Employees can delegate some or all of their points to other members or panels of experts for specific proposals.

**Examples of Delegation:**
- *Delegating to a Single Expert:* ‚ÄúThis proposal is tagged ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô. Delegate 500 points, on this proposal, to Bruce Schneier.‚Äù
- *Delegating to a Panel of Experts:* ‚ÄúThis proposal is tagged 'security'. Delegate 1000 points, to this proposal. 10% to Bruce Schneier, 20% to Matt Blaze, and 70% to Brianna Wu."
- *Customized Delegation:* "Make my vote the same as Joe Smith's, except take all the points he allocated to 'equipment purchase', and reallocate them to 'education' (70%) and 'software purchase' (30%)."
