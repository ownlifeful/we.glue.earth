# Open Source Software Cooperative

## About Us

**we.glue.earth** is an Open Source Software Cooperative, formed with a vision to unite skilled individuals from various backgrounds ‚Äì programmers, designers, artists, writers, and more ‚Äì under one banner. We aim to provide a platform for unemployed workers who have time, skills, and a desire to contribute to meaningful, cutting-edge, open-source projects.

## Our Mission

To build a de-commercialized, democratized, and decluttered collection of all human knowledge, providing a foundation for future innovators to build upon, starting with the **Alexandria3000** app.

## The Alexandria3000 App

**Alexandria3000** is designed as an AI-powered app aiming to revolutionize the way we learn and master Computer Science. It dynamically adjusts to an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency and accelerates the learning process. For more about the app, visit [Alexandria3000.com](http://alexandria3000.com).

## Get Involved

We‚Äôre looking for visionaries who are interested in investing their time, skills, and capital into this project. As part of our cooperative, you will have a voice in shaping the future of this initiative.

## The Cooperative Model

- **Democratic Operation:** We elect officers, maintain a charter and bylaws, hold regular meetings, and keep minutes.
- **Equal Ownership:** Each worker owns an equal share in the cooperative.
- **Contract-to-Hire:** New recruits will start as contract-to-hire workers for 3 months, after which all employees will vote on their permanent status.
- **Peer Review & Reward System:** Employees are peer-reviewed and can be rewarded bonuses from the cooperative‚Äôs collective funds based on performance, as decided collectively by all members.

### Leaving the Cooperative

Should a worker decide to leave, their share will be bought out, and they will be compensated, keeping the ownership always in the hands of the workers.

## Collective Decision Making

We use a points-based system for collective decision-making, where each employee has 1000 points. Proposals are made by members and voted upon, using these points. Members can also delegate their points to other members or panels of experts, depending on the nature of the proposal.

### Examples of Delegation

1. **Delegating to a Single Expert:** ‚ÄúThis proposal is tagged ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô. Delegate 500 points, on this proposal, to Bruce Schneier.‚Äù
2. **Delegating to a Panel of Experts:** ‚ÄúThis proposal is tagged 'security'. Delegate 1000 points, to this proposal. 10% to Bruce Schneier, 20% to Matt Blaze, and 70% to Brianna Wu."
3. **Customized Delegation:** "Make my vote the same as Joe Smith's, except take all the points he allocated to 'equipment purchase', and reallocate them to 'education' (70%) and 'software purchase' (30%)."
