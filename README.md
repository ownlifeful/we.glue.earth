# we.glue.earth Open Source Software Cooperative

## Vision

At **we.glue.earth**, our mission is to empower individuals through the principles of Free and Open Software, collective action, and decentralized knowledge. We champion a world where knowledge is democratized, technology is transparent, and everyone can contribute their unique talents.

## The Power of Free and Open Software (FOSS)

Open software promotes collaboration, ensures transparency, and champions user freedom. Our commitment: all software developed by our cooperative will be released as FOSS, predominantly under the GPL. This ensures our contributions stand as communal assets, fostering innovation and upholding user rights.

## Empowerment, Freedom, and Inclusivity

At **we.glue.earth**, we recognize that every individual brings a unique set of skills and perspectives. Here, roles are not confined. Hired for business development but also have a knack for music? We value and can utilize that. Our cooperative structure ensures that everyone's voice is heard. Anyone can propose ideas, and the best ones are championed and benefit everyone. 

Work from anywhere, full-time or part-time. Our focus is on effective communication, attending scheduled meetings (online or offline), and meeting shared goals. Discrimination has no place here. Our primary objective is your success, which translates into our collective triumph.

## Cooperative Policies

- **Democracy in Action:** Our cooperative functions democratically. We elect officers, maintain a charter and bylaws, hold meetings, and keep records.
  
- **Shared Ownership:** Each worker owns an equal stake in the cooperative.

- **Hiring and Onboarding:** New recruits undergo a contract-to-hire period of 3 months. Following this, all employees vote on permanent hiring.

- **Rewarding Excellence:** Employees who add significant value are eligible for bonuses. These are awarded based on collective decision.

- **Supportive Environment:** We decide collectively on measures to aid or discipline underperforming peers.

- **Exiting the Cooperative:** Should an employee leave, their share will be bought out, ensuring ownership remains with the workers.

## Democratic Operation & Collective Decision Making

Every employee is granted 1,000 points to use in our decision-making system. Proposals are created by employees, and points are allocated to vote on them. Crucially, employees can delegate points‚Äîfully or in part‚Äîto others, allowing specialized knowledge to play a pivotal role in decision-making.
